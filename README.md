# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project was to create a website on UFO sightings that allows users to filter sighting based on the date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
The website displays UFO sighting reported around the world and gives users the option to filter for specific UFO sightings based date, city, state, country, and shape. The results are provided in a table that lists the date, city, state, country, shape, duration, and comments about the sighting.

## Summary
One design drawback is that the filters are case sensitive. Entering the state as "OR" returns no results but entering "or" returns three results. State abbriviations are traditionally entered in uppercase only and might cause confusion with users. Also, the default text filter is dark and could cause confusion if those values are also part of the filtering or not. Some changes I would recommend would be to add a "Clear" button for the search filters. Or, change the filter from free-form text boxe to a drop-down menu that lists only the values that correspond to the data.
